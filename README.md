"# PopCorn-Machine" 
 My machine named PopMatic, is an automated popcorn
 production system designed to prepare flavored
 popcorn cups with minimal human effort. The idea
 behind the project is to make the process of preparing
 popcorn faster, easier, and more consistent by
 automating the different steps from dispensing
 ingredients to serving the final product.
 The goal is to provide a smart and efficient solution that
 can improve user experience, save time, and ensure
 better quality compared to traditional manual
 preparation.
